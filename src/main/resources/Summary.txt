Project Description:
  This project is a JavaFX-based application that simulates a customizable online jewelry store,
  where users can design and order bead jewelry items such as necklaces, bracelets, and rings.
  The application is built using object-oriented principles and incorporates five GUI windows to walk the user through the entire process—from entering personal details to viewing a final order receipt.

How All Required Elements Were Incorporated:

1. Classes & Inheritance:
   - JewelryItem is the main class used to represent bead jewelry items.
   - Shared and unique attributes are handled using class design and object creation.

2. Composition:
   - The application uses composition by combining different GUI components (TextFields, ComboBoxes, etc.) into each window layout.
   - A JewelryItem object includes multiple properties like shape, color, type, and size.

3. Interfaces:
   - Methods are used consistently in a modular way (like addCart, showAlert) to simulate reusable behavior, even if a formal interface wasn't declared.

4. GUI with Multiple Windows (JavaFX):
   - Window 1: Customer Info
   - Window 2: Jewelry Customization (color, shape, type, size)
   - Window 3: Address Entry
   - Window 4: Cart Summary
   - Window 5: Order Confirmation & Receipt

5. Error Handling:
   - Input validation is performed at each step.
   - Users receive alert messages if required fields are left blank or selections are invalid.

6. Data Validation:
   - Checks if the cart is empty before proceeding.
   - Validates number-only input for size.
   - Ensures all fields are completed before placing an order.

7. Hash Maps:
   - A nested HashMap<String, Map<String, List<String>>> is used to control how bead types are loaded based on the selected shape and color.

8. Alert Messages:
   - JavaFX Alert dialogs are used for validation and to guide the user when an error is made (e.g., missing name, empty cart).

9. File Handling:
   - The receipt can be saved to a text file using BufferedWriter, including all customer and order details.

10. String Formatting:
   - String.format() is used to present a clean layout of items in the cart and in the receipt file.

New Things I Learned:
- How to use HashMaps to organize and access nested data.
- How to show JavaFX Alert messages to validate user input(show Alert).
- How to use file handling in Java to write data to a text file.
- How to use String.format to make text output neat and readable.

Challenges Faced:
- Managing data across multiple JavaFX windows.
- Ensuring validation works correctly at every step.
- Keeping the user interface simple while handling complex options like shape, color, and type in the hash map.
- Debugging layout spacing and input field issues.
